I was on my Amtrak train the other night and realized that the speed wasn't displayed on the train tracker, something that obviously [bothers me more than others](http://apologizeamtrak.com).

This tool uses a publicly available API available when you're connected to Amtrak WiFi to update speed every 2 seconds.

# Demo

You can see a demo here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igtIpV258Hc&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igtIpV258Hc&feature=youtu.be)

# Usage

This will only work on an Amtrak train while you're connected to their WiFi.
